WTFSC
=====
## WTF is it?
This is a calculator, designed currently for the
command line, that is fed by s-expressions.

It is done as a homework left by our school
activity.
## WTF would it be useful?
* Never
* As late[sic] as we go to 1.0
* Alternatively, when others start to send push
requests
## WTF is the language?
Our school activity teaches C#, but the author
instead uses C & Python which he thinks is better.
(C# is designed for Windows.)
